## SQLDelight
SQLDelight is one the few SQLite drivers that supports Kotlin Multiplatform and is used in almost all KMP samples and showcase apps. 

It does not expose many compiler options but does include some good defaults that make extension loading possible. The library shows consistent performance across various platforms when compiling for KMP. It does not allow direct access to the SQLite C API which is provided by the SQLiter library under the hood. 

SQDelight does however have a rich SQLite API which generates type-safe Kotlin APIs from SQL which makes writing and maintaining SQL statements much easier. It does support querying the database asynchronously and allows the database to be configured for concurrent read transactions (using WAL mode).
