## Configurability

Configurability refers to the library’s flexibility in allowing developers to customize its behavior and functionality to meet specific application needs. This includes access to compiler options, using a good set of default extensions and catering for extension loading.

## Consistency

Consistency ensures the library has consistent options across various platforms, capabilities should be consistent across platforms with sensible default settings, and cross-platform SDKs should directly access the C API without converting to another language first.

## Capability

Capability evaluates the library’s inclusion of a comprehensive transaction API, exposure of all possible parameter types, and good to have functionality such as update hooks (used for watching for changes), prepared statements and creating user-defined functions.
