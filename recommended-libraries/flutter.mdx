## sqlite_async

We recommend sqlite_async because it wraps the sqlite3 Dart bindings and configures the database with a good set of defaults, with all database calls being asynchronous to avoid blocking the UI.

While it does not expose compiler options, it does cater for loading various extensions. It also ensures that core SQLite functionality is consistent across all platforms supported by the library.

For performance-sensitive tasks, transactions are asynchronous and concurrent by default (multiple read and single write) by using a pool of connections, each running in a separate Isolate. Allows the use of SQL queries directly, making complex queries easier, and does not require any code generation. Allows access to the underlying SQLite3 library when high-performance low-level access is required. Allows the use of Drift when an ORM is required.
