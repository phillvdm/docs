## wa-sqlite

wa-sqlite leverages WebAssembly (Wasm), allowing SQLite to run efficiently in web browser environments. The Wasm build is highly customizable by providing access to compiler options and having a good set of default options, however, it does not enable extension loading by default.

This Wasm build of SQLite supports writing to SQLite virtual file systems (VFS) completely in JavaScript and allows for alternative browser storage options such as IndexedDB and Origin Private File System (OPFS). Both the synchronous and asynchronous builds use the same set of default options and provide a consistent way to access the SQLite C API through JavaScript wrappers.

It does not provide an easy-to-use transaction API. It requires manual setup for concurrent read transactions. It does not include any update or commit hooks. Both builds allow the use of SQL queries directly, and support the use of prepared statements.
