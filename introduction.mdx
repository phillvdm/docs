title: In-App SQLite
description: "Resources for implementing SQLite as an in-app database for mobile, desktop or browser-based apps."

## Background/Genesis

SQLite is the perfect in-app database, but the SQLite project itself only offers a low-level C library. To effectively use it in a higher-level language, you need much more.

What you need can be broken down into layers:

1. A SQLite build for each OS + architecture (e.g. windows_x86). There are many possible compiler options to configure the build, or it can be replaced with an alternative (e.g. SQLCipher, or libsql).
2. Low-level language bindings, e.g. https://pub.dev/packages/sqlite3. This is often a one-to-one mapping to the SQLite C APIs, or with minor modifications for the specific language.
3. (Optional) High-level bindings: Wrapper methods for transactions, batch updates, potential concurrency support, migrations, query builders.
4. ORM.

Layers 1, 2 and sometimes 3 are often combined in the same library.

Since each layer can be implemented in a different way, higher-level SQLite libraries can vary greatly in their features and performance.
