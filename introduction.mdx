## TL;DR
There's no standard implementation of SQLite for higher-level languages. This guide provides resources to navigate available options.

## Background/Genesis

SQLite is the perfect in-app database, but the SQLite project itself only offers a low-level C library. To effectively use it in a higher-level language, you need much more.

What you need can be broken down into layers:

1. **A SQLite build for each OS + architecture (e.g. windows_x86).** There are many possible compiler options to configure the build, or it can be replaced with an alternative (e.g. SQLCipher, or libsql).
2. **Low-level language bindings** This is often a one-to-one mapping to the SQLite C APIs, or with minor modifications for the specific language.
3. **(Optional) High-level bindings:** Wrapper methods for transactions, batch updates, potential concurrency support, migrations, query builders.
4. **ORM.**

Layers 1, 2 and sometimes 3 are often combined in the same library.

Since each layer can be implemented in a different way, higher-level SQLite libraries can vary greatly in their features and performance.

### Typical issues

#### Layer 1: SQLite build
- This is not always packaged separately - often part of layer 2.
- Compile options are often inconsistent
    - May differ between platforms
    - Does not include a good default set of extensions
    - Often not compiled with extension loading enabled
- Not always updated quickly

#### Layer 2: Low-level language bindings
- Often bundles layer 1, with no good way to configure or replace it.
    - Sometimes does allow replacing layer 1, but with great effort.
- Transactions APIs are very limited in some cases.
- In cross-platform SDKs (e.g. Flutter, React Native, Cordova, Capacitor), it often goes through the “native” code (Swift/Objective-C/Java/Kotlin) first before going to the C API. This adds additional overhead, making it slow and sometimes inconsistent between platforms.
- Often uses the OS’s built-in SQLite lib, making the SQLite version dependent on the user’s device.
- In some cases, does not expose all possible parameter types.
    - Android only allows string parameters - other types have to be converted.
    - Common to not allow binary parameters directly.
- Good-to-have functionality is often not exposed, such as:
    - Update hooks (used for watching for changes).
    - Commit hooks (less commonly used)
    - Low-level / high-performance query APIs, e.g. preparing statements.
    - Ability to create user-defined functions.

#### Layer 3: High-level bindings
Specific issues are not as common in this layer, but the functionality provided is very inconsistent.

Examples of functionality:
- Proper transaction wrappers with locking support.
- Asynchronous versions of all methods if relevant in the language.
- Concurrency support via connection pooling.
- Watching for updates to tables, or higher-level watching queries.
- Query builders.
- Migration support.
- Efficient batch updates.

## Mission

This guide aims to provide an overview of the available options for implementing SQLite in higher-level languages, and recommend the best options for each language.
