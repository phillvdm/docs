## op-sqlite

op-sqlite provides a low-level API for executing SQL queries within React Native. It provides access to compiler options configurable through the package.json file and caters for loading additional extensions.

It provides a consistent set of options across compatible platforms and direct access to the SQLite C API through JavaScript. It provides a comprehensive transaction API, exposes multiple parameter types and includes update hooks for various operations such as table or row updates. It also has support for prepared statements out of the box.

While it does not have the niceties of an ORM, it has a smaller footprint resulting in a smaller app size and better performance.
